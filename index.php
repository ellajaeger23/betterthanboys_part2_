                   We’re BTB — a group of women in the university’s Department of Digital Learning & Research. Think of us as your go-to crew for mixing technology, creativity, and collaboration. We’re building projects, asking big questions, and making the academic grind a little brighter. And yes — we’re looking for more people to join us. Could that be you?

                        At BTB, our mission isn’t just to produce research papers.  
                        We’re here to create meaningful, slightly eccentric, and genuinely impactful ways 
                        to use technology in education — with a healthy dose of humor to keep us sane.
